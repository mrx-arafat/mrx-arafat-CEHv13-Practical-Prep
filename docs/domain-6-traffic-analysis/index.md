## Overview

Network traffic contains everything: passwords, commands, data exfiltration, attacker communications. Analyzing this traffic reveals the full attack picture.

**Key Topics:**
- Wireshark packet analysis and filtering
- Tcpdump command-line capture
- Tshark CLI analysis
- DDoS attack identification
- OS fingerprinting via TTL analysis
- MQTT IoT protocol analysis
- RAT detection in traffic

**Duration:** 15-30 minutes per task  
**Difficulty:** Medium to Hard  
**Tools:** Wireshark, tcpdump, tshark

## 6.1 Wireshark Basics

### What It Does

Wireshark opens a packet capture (`.pcap`/`.pcapng`) and lets you filter, follow, and read every byte that crossed the wire. In CEH practical you're usually handed a capture file and asked a question: *what's the attacker IP, what password was sent, what file was exfiltrated.* The whole game is **the right display filter + Follow Stream**.

> **Exam tip:** Don't scroll thousands of packets by hand. Filter to narrow the haystack, then right-click → **Follow → TCP Stream** to read the full conversation as plain text. 90% of answers fall out of this.

### Opening & Filtering

```
File → Open → Select .pcap or .pcapng file
```

> **Display filter vs capture filter:** the top bar (green = valid) is a *display* filter — `tcp.port == 80`. Capture filters (BPF, set before capture) use different syntax — `port 80`. Exam files are pre-captured, so you use display filters.

### Common Filters

```
http                    # HTTP traffic only
https or tls            # HTTPS traffic
ip.src == 192.168.1.5   # Source IP
ip.dst == 10.0.0.1      # Destination IP
ip.addr == 192.168.1.5  # Either src OR dst (most useful)
tcp.port == 80          # TCP port
udp.port == 53          # UDP port
tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0   # SYN-only (scan/flood)
tcp contains "admin"    # Any TCP packet with this string
frame contains "password"   # Search whole frame for a string
mqtt                    # MQTT protocol
ftp                     # FTP traffic
dns                     # DNS queries
icmp                    # Ping / ICMP
```

> **Combine filters:** `&&` (and), `||` (or), `!` (not). Example: `http && ip.addr==10.0.0.5 && http.request.method=="POST"`.

### Finding Credentials — Workflow

```
http.request.method == "POST"          # Login attempts (creds in body)
http.authbasic                         # HTTP Basic Auth (base64 user:pass)
frame contains "password"              # Any protocol leaking the word
ftp.request.command == "USER" || ftp.request.command == "PASS"   # FTP login (cleartext)
telnet                                 # Telnet = fully cleartext
tcp.port == 3306                       # MySQL traffic
```

**Steps to pull a cleartext credential:**
1. Filter to the protocol (`http`, `ftp`, `telnet`).
2. Find the login packet (POST / `USER` / `PASS`).
3. Right-click → **Follow → TCP Stream** → read user + password in the conversation.
4. HTTP Basic Auth? The header is `Authorization: Basic <base64>` — decode it: `echo dXNlcjpwYXNz | base64 -d`.

### Follow Stream & Export

```
Right-click packet → Follow → TCP/UDP/HTTP Stream    # Read full conversation
File → Export Objects → HTTP                          # Pull files/images transferred over HTTP
Statistics → Protocol Hierarchy                       # What protocols are in this capture?
Statistics → Conversations                            # Who talked to who, byte/packet counts
```

> **Exam tip:** "What file did the attacker download/exfiltrate?" → **File → Export Objects → HTTP** lists and saves every transferred file.

## 6.2 Tcpdump - Command-Line Capture

### Basic Capture

```bash
tcpdump -i eth0                        # Capture on interface
tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap        # Save to file
tcpdump -i eth0 -c 100 -w output.pcap  # Capture 100 packets
```

### Filtering

```bash
# TCP only
tcpdump -i eth0 tcp

# Specific IP
tcpdump -i eth0 src 192.168.1.5
tcpdump -i eth0 dst 10.0.0.0/8

# Specific port
tcpdump -i eth0 port 80
tcpdump -i eth0 dst port 443

# Port range
tcpdump -i eth0 portrange 1000-2000

# Complex filter
tcpdump -i eth0 "tcp port 80 or tcp port 443"
```

### Display Options

```bash
# Hex and ASCII output (find passwords!)
tcpdump -i eth0 -X "tcp port 21"

# ASCII only
tcpdump -i eth0 -A "tcp port 80"

# Verbose
tcpdump -v -i eth0 tcp
```

### Reading PCAP Files

```bash
# Read capture
tcpdump -r capture.pcap

# Apply filter to file
tcpdump -r capture.pcap "tcp port 80"

# Extract to new file
tcpdump -r capture.pcap -w filtered.pcap "tcp and port 443"
```

---

## 6.3 Tshark - CLI Wireshark

### Basic Usage

```bash
tshark -r capture.pcapng                # Read PCAP
tshark -r capture.pcapng -Y "http"      # Apply filter
tshark -r capture.pcapng -V              # Verbose
```

### Extract Fields

```bash
# IP addresses
tshark -r capture.pcapng -T fields -e ip.src -e ip.dst

# HTTP requests
tshark -r capture.pcapng -Y "http.request" -T fields -e http.method -e http.host -e http.request.uri

# FTP credentials
tshark -r capture.pcapng -Y "ftp.request.command == 'USER' or ftp.request.command == 'PASS'" -T fields -e ftp.request.command -e ftp.request.arg

# DNS queries
tshark -r capture.pcapng -Y "dns.qry.name" -T fields -e dns.qry.name

# MQTT topics
tshark -r capture.pcapng -Y "mqtt.msgtype == 3" -T fields -e mqtt.topic -e mqtt.msg
```

### Output Formats

```bash
tshark -r capture.pcapng -T json > output.json      # JSON
tshark -r capture.pcapng -T csv > output.csv        # CSV
tshark -r capture.pcapng -T fields -e field1 -e field2  # Custom
```

## 6.4 DDoS / Flood Attack Analysis

### What It Does

A flood drowns a target in packets from one (DoS) or many (DDoS) sources. In the capture it looks like **one destination hammered by a huge volume of near-identical packets**. Your job: name the attacker IP(s) and the attack type.

### Finding the Attacker IP

```
Statistics → Conversations → sort by Packets (descending)   # Top talker = attacker
Statistics → Endpoints → sort by Packets                    # Single IP dominates = source
Filter: ip.dst == 172.22.10.10                              # Lock to the victim, see who floods it
```

> **DDoS vs DoS:** many source IPs all hitting one victim = **DDoS**. One source IP = **DoS**. Endpoints/Conversations counts tell you which.

### Identifying the Attack Type (Signatures)

| Attack | Filter / Signature | Tell |
|--------|--------------------|------|
| **SYN flood** | `tcp.flags.syn==1 && tcp.flags.ack==0` | Flood of SYNs, no completed handshakes |
| **ACK flood** | `tcp.flags.ack==1 && tcp.flags.syn==0` | Mass ACKs to a port with no session |
| **ICMP/Ping flood** | `icmp` | Huge volume of echo requests |
| **UDP flood** | `udp` | Many UDP packets to random/closed ports |
| **DNS amplification** | `dns && udp.length > 300` | Big DNS responses to a spoofed victim |
| **HTTP flood** | `http.request` | Flood of GET/POST from many IPs (L7) |

### Confirming Volume

```
Statistics → I/O Graph        # Spike in packets/sec = the attack window
Statistics → Protocol Hierarchy   # One protocol abnormally dominant (e.g. 99% TCP SYN)
```

## 6.5 OS Fingerprinting via TTL

### What It Does

Every OS sets a default starting **TTL** (Time To Live) on outgoing packets. Each router hop decrements it by 1. Read the TTL, round UP to the nearest default, and you know the sender's OS — without scanning it.

### TTL Values by OS

| OS | Default TTL |
|----|------------|
| Windows | 128 |
| Linux/Unix | 64 |
| macOS | 64 |
| Cisco | 255 |

### TTL Analysis

```
Observed TTL: 128 → Windows (no hops)
Observed TTL: 126 → Windows (2 hops: 128-2)
Observed TTL: 64  → Linux (no hops)
Observed TTL: 62  → Linux (2 hops: 64-2)
```

### In Wireshark

```
Filter: ip.ttl == 128          # All Windows packets
Filter: ip.ttl == 64           # All Linux packets
Filter: ip.src == 203.0.113.45 && ip.ttl  # Check specific attacker
```

## 6.6 MQTT IoT Protocol

### What It Does

MQTT is the lightweight publish/subscribe protocol IoT devices use. Sensors **PUBLISH** to a **topic** (e.g. `home/livingroom/temp`); subscribers receive it. On port 1883 it's **unencrypted** — topics, payloads, and often credentials sit in cleartext. Exam asks: what topic, what value, what creds.

### Common Ports

- 1883 = MQTT (unencrypted)
- 8883 = MQTT over TLS
- 9001 = MQTT over WebSockets

### MQTT Message Types

- 1 = CONNECT
- 3 = PUBLISH (actual data)
- 8 = SUBSCRIBE
- 10 = UNSUBSCRIBE

### Analyzing MQTT

```
Filter: mqtt                          # All MQTT traffic
Filter: mqtt.msgtype == 3             # PUBLISH messages only
Filter: mqtt.msgtype == 1             # CONNECT messages
Filter: mqtt.topic contains "temp"    # Topic search
```

### Extracting Topics

```bash
tshark -r capture.pcapng -Y "mqtt.msgtype == 3" -T fields -e mqtt.topic
```

> **Exam tip:** MQTT creds ride in the **CONNECT** packet (`mqtt.msgtype == 1`) — fields `mqtt.username` and `mqtt.passwd` in cleartext on port 1883.

## 6.7 RAT / C2 Detection in Traffic

### What It Does

A RAT (Remote Access Trojan) makes the infected host **call out** to an attacker's Command & Control (C2) server, then takes commands back. In a capture it shows as an internal host beaconing to a suspicious external IP on an odd port, at regular intervals.

### What to Look For

| Signal | How to Spot It |
|--------|----------------|
| **Beaconing** | Same internal→external pair, regular interval (e.g. every 30s). `Statistics → Conversations`, look for steady periodic small packets |
| **Odd port** | C2 on non-standard ports (4444 Metasploit, 1604, high random). `tcp.port == 4444` |
| **Reverse shell** | Outbound connection from server to attacker, then interactive text. Follow TCP Stream shows commands/output |
| **Suspicious external IP** | Internal host talking to an unknown public IP. `ip.dst == <external>` |
| **DNS tunneling** | Long, random-looking subdomains in DNS queries = data exfil. `dns.qry.name` with abnormal length |

### Filters

```
tcp.port == 4444                       # Common Metasploit/reverse-shell port
ip.dst == 203.0.113.66                 # Suspected C2 IP — see all beacons
tcp.flags.push == 1 && tcp.len > 0     # Interactive shell data (commands/output)
dns                                    # Then scan for long random subdomains (tunneling)
```

**Workflow:** `Statistics → Conversations` → spot the internal host beaconing to one external IP → filter that pair → **Follow TCP Stream** → read the C2 commands.
